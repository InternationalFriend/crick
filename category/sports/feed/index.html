<p>Manchester City&#8217;s Norwegian star Arling Haaland and French footballer Kylian Mbappe have again crowned Lionel Messi as FIFA&#8217;s best player of the year. This World Cup winning footballer won the &#8216;FIFA The Best&#8217; award after a hard-fought battle.</p>



<p>Arling Haaland and Messi had equal votes. However, Messi became the first as he was ahead of the national team captains in the first choice list. Not only the captain, but also the coaches of the national teams voted for the player of the year. Media representatives from different countries also voted for the player of the year.</p>



<p>Bangladesh national football team captain Jamal Bhuiyan and coach Javier Cabrera also voted for the best player. Jamal topped Messi&#8217;s best male player poll. Jamal&#8217;s third best player voted for Holland was City star Kevin De Bruyne.</p>



<p>Jamal placed Messi on top of all, but Messi is not in the top three of Spanish coach Cabrera of Bangladesh. In the eyes of the Spanish coach, Holland is the best footballer in 2023. Cabrera&#8217;s next two votes also went to the Premier League and Champions League winning City players&#8217; box. Cabrera&#8217;s second best is Rodri, third best is Ilkay Gundwan.</p>



<p>In addition, in the selection of the best players of the women&#8217;s team, Bangladesh women&#8217;s team captain Sabina Khatun&#8217;s preferred order was Hinata Miyazawa, Sam Carr and Alex Greenwood. None of them made it to the top three. Saiful Bari, the coach of the women&#8217;s team, was voted the best female footballer in the box of Aitana Bonmati.</p>



<p>Raihan Mahmud has voted as the representative of the journalists of Bangladesh. Holland is the best in his eyes. He kept Messi in two. Like Cabrera, he is the third best Gundoan in his eyes.</p>

<p>Brothers Union lost 5-0 to Bashundhara Kings in the Premier League. This time the team of Gopibag lost by a big margin in the Federation Cup.Abahani beat Brothers 6-0 today at Bashundhara Kings Arena. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Washington scored a hat trick for the team. Apart from this, Cornelius scored two goals and Nabib Newaz Jiban scored the other goal. Andres Cruciani&#8217;s Abahani took the lead 15 minutes into the match at the Bashundhara Kings Arena. Washington&#8217;s cross from the edge was not cleared properly by the defender inside the box. Jeevan made no mistake getting the ball in the gap to beat the goalkeeper. After 15 minutes the margin of the match was doubled. Washington is the scorer this time. Brothers Union changed the goalkeeper in the 35th minute. The first half ended with a 2-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>After the break, Abahani&#8217;s attempts were blocked once again by the goalkeeper. In the 56th minute, Cornelius&#8217; shot was blocked by goalkeeper Majnu Mia. It was the Granada striker&#8217;s fifth shot.</p>



<p>Until 70 minutes the Brothers somehow held the defense. However, the next minute was flooded with goals. This half came four more goals! In other words, Abahani opened the scoreboard again in the 71st minute. Taking the ball off a defender&#8217;s feet, Washington entered the box alone and found the goalkeeper alone to give the team the lead for the third goal. Two minutes later Robiul&#8217;s powerful shot from Jonathan&#8217;s free-kick could not be properly saved by a defender. Washington tapped in from in front of the post to complete his first hat trick of the season.</p>



<p>In the 82nd minute, Granada&#8217;s forward Cornelius entered the box from the right side and scored with a strong shot. Cornelius scored another goal in the 86th minute. Cornelius put the final nail in the Brothers&#8217; coffin with a superb left-footed backheel pass from Washington.</p>
