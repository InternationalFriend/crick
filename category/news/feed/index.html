<p><strong>Comilla:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A child died 12 days after being admitted to Holy Care Hospital in Tomsombridge area of ​​the city.&nbsp;The family claims that the child died because of the doctor&#8217;s mistake.</p>



<p>They say that their son was suffering from heart problem.&nbsp;But for the last 12 days doctors were treating his cold without proper treatment.</p>



<p>Sunday (November 12) at 5 pm.&nbsp;The child named Hossain died. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Goliara South Union of Sadar South Upazila of Comilla said.&nbsp;Hossein son of Soleimani.&nbsp;He was 2 months and 14 days old.</p>



<p>Soleman, the father of the child, said that on October 28, I brought my son to Holy Care Hospital with a cold.&nbsp;Then Dr.&nbsp;On the advice of Abdul Qayyum, he was admitted to the hospital.&nbsp;My son was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 10 November.&nbsp;Doctors did not do any echo or heart test before this.&nbsp;They suddenly told us on October 10 that three quarters of my child&#8217;s heart was damaged. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the question why wrong treatment or blaming the doctor, he said, if the doctor had told us about my child&#8217;s heart problem on the first day, we would have taken him to Dhaka or taken him elsewhere for treatment.&nbsp;But they didn&#8217;t tell us anything.&nbsp;No tests were done to diagnose my child&#8217;s heart problem.&nbsp;We will take legal action in this matter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Child&#8217;s mother Seema Akter said, I used to sell blood for my child.&nbsp;We did what the doctor said.&nbsp;But the doctor did not treat our child on time.&nbsp;We knew about cold and cough, and heard about heart problem two days ago. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the complaint of the dead child&#8217;s parents, the accused doctor Qayyum could not be found.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, after hearing the news of the child&#8217;s death, when he went to the hospital on Sunday to collect news, there was a scuffle with a TV channel journalist and the channel&#8217;s camera was allegedly taken away by the director of the hospital.&nbsp;Against Morshedul Alam. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The television channel&#8217;s cameraperson was injured in the incident.&nbsp;Colleagues took him to Comilla Sadar Hospital. &nbsp;</p>



<p>President of Comilla Press Club Lutfar Rahman strongly condemned the incident of misbehaving with the journalist and taking away the camera in the hospital. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Hospital director Dr.&nbsp;Morshedul Alam admitted to taking away the camera and said, I asked the journalist to meet me downstairs.&nbsp;I&#8217;m angry why they didn&#8217;t meet.&nbsp;If there is a complaint from the patient&#8217;s family, he is asked to complain to the Civil Surgeon. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Comilla Civil Surgeon in this regard.&nbsp;Nachima Akhter said that the issue of Holy Care Hospital will be investigated.</p>

<p><strong>Dhaka:</strong>&nbsp;At present, about one crore 31 lakh people are suffering from diabetes in the country.&nbsp;Bangladesh ranks eighth in the world in the number of patients suffering from diabetes.</p>



<p>Bangladesh Endocrine Society gave these information in a press conference organized on Monday (November 13) morning on &#8216;Know your diabetes risk and what to do&#8217;.&nbsp;Bangladesh Endocrine Society organized this press conference at Jahur Hossain Hall of National Press Club on the occasion of World Diabetes Day.</p>



<p>In the press conference, General Secretary of Bangladesh Endocrine Society and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Associate Professor Dr.&nbsp;Shahzada Salim said, November 14 is World Diabetes Day.&nbsp;At present, about 1 crore 31 lakh people are suffering from diabetes in the country and Bangladesh ranks eighth in the world.&nbsp;Experts fear that this number may double in the next four years.&nbsp;As such, it is feared that the number of diabetes patients, one of the four non-communicable diseases of the country, may reach one and a half crore by 2025.</p>



<p>The press conference was also attended by the chief sponsor of Bangladesh Endocrine Society and director (education) of Bardem Hospital.&nbsp;Md.&nbsp;Farooq Pathan, President (elect) Professor Mohammad Hafizur Rahman, Vice President and Bardem Hospital Associate Professor Dr.&nbsp;Faria Afsana, member of the executive committee and expert doctor of Evercare Hospital.&nbsp;Ahsanul Haque Amin, Office Secretary and Assistant Professor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.&nbsp;Marufa Mostari.</p>



<p>These eminent doctors of the country said that Bangladesh is currently a diabetes-prone country in the world and the actual situation is more serious than that.&nbsp;At present, diabetes patients are increasing almost equally in urban and rural areas.&nbsp;Therefore taking into consideration the serious situation and taking effective measures to prevent it now is the need of the hour.</p>



<p>They also said that if action is not taken now, the situation will go out of control.&nbsp;It is very important to ensure coordinated action planning at all levels and from affordable drug delivery to other collaborative management in diabetic patient care.</p>



<p>About what to do to control diabetes, they said, 61.8 percent of the country&#8217;s patients do not know that they are suffering from diabetes.&nbsp;Because most patients don&#8217;t get regular diabetes checkups.&nbsp;So it is important for everyone, whether they have diabetes or not, to get tested for diabetes at least once a year.&nbsp;Along with reducing the amount of sugar in the food should be increased meat and vegetables.&nbsp;In addition, it is necessary to eat healthy food, avoid harmful food including fast food, walk regularly, play sports.&nbsp;If one is suffering from diabetes, then one should take the treatment as advised by the doctor.</p>



<p>These doctors said that it is necessary to take various measures at the national level to control diabetes.</p>
