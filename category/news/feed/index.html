<p><strong>This time he also set a world record. And based on that, New Zealand has won the series in addition to three consecutive wins.</strong></p>



<p>The hosts beat Pakistan by 45 runs in the third T20 of the series in Dunedin. Batting first, Allen&#8217;s devastating century made New Zealand a huge collection of 225 runs. In reply, despite Babar Azam&#8217;s third consecutive fifty, Pakistan lost 179 by 45 runs.</p>



<p>Pakistan fell under the grip of Allen-storm in the first match. He destroyed the Pakistani bowlers by playing an innings of 34 runs off just 15 balls. He scored 74 runs in 41 balls in the second match. Today, a 62-ball 137-run innings came from his bat. He hit 16 sixes!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The record for most sixes in T20 International was held by Hazratullah Zazai. He hit 16 sixes on his way to an innings of 162 runs against Ireland in Dehradun in 2019. Allen broke his record. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Allen&#8217;s 137 runs are New Zealand&#8217;s individual highest in T20 Internationals. This Kiwi batter has broken Brandon McCullum&#8217;s record set a century ago. Former Kiwi captain McCullum scored 123 off 58 balls against Bangladesh at Pallekele, Sri Lanka in 2012 World Cup.</p>



<p>Allen&#8217;s achievements do not end here. His innings is the fifth highest in T20 Internationals. Even against Pakistan, no batsman could score so many runs in one match. The previous highest was Mark Chapman&#8217;s 52-ball 104 in Rawalpindi last April. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan almost got knocked out of the match after the Allen-Storm. Because Pakistan does not have a record of winning by chasing more than 208 runs. They won this run chase against West Indies in Karachi in 2021. Pakistan&#8217;s top order did not do well in batting with the aim of making a record.</p>



<p>In addition to not being able to score runs with the ball, losing wickets in the early stages put Pakistan under pressure. Opener Saim Ayyub returned with 10 runs off 13 balls. After that, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan scored 39 runs together but played the ball for 28 runs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After that, Fakhar Zaman, who was dropped for four, departed after scoring 19 runs off 10 balls, practically ending Pakistan&#8217;s hopes. Although Babar scored 58 runs off 37 balls today. But Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed failed. As a result, Pakistan left the field with a loss.</p>
