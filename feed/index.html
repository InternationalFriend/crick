<p><strong>This time he also set a world record. And based on that, New Zealand has won the series in addition to three consecutive wins.</strong></p>



<p>The hosts beat Pakistan by 45 runs in the third T20 of the series in Dunedin. Batting first, Allen&#8217;s devastating century made New Zealand a huge collection of 225 runs. In reply, despite Babar Azam&#8217;s third consecutive fifty, Pakistan lost 179 by 45 runs.</p>



<p>Pakistan fell under the grip of Allen-storm in the first match. He destroyed the Pakistani bowlers by playing an innings of 34 runs off just 15 balls. He scored 74 runs in 41 balls in the second match. Today, a 62-ball 137-run innings came from his bat. He hit 16 sixes!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The record for most sixes in T20 International was held by Hazratullah Zazai. He hit 16 sixes on his way to an innings of 162 runs against Ireland in Dehradun in 2019. Allen broke his record. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Allen&#8217;s 137 runs are New Zealand&#8217;s individual highest in T20 Internationals. This Kiwi batter has broken Brandon McCullum&#8217;s record set a century ago. Former Kiwi captain McCullum scored 123 off 58 balls against Bangladesh at Pallekele, Sri Lanka in 2012 World Cup.</p>



<p>Allen&#8217;s achievements do not end here. His innings is the fifth highest in T20 Internationals. Even against Pakistan, no batsman could score so many runs in one match. The previous highest was Mark Chapman&#8217;s 52-ball 104 in Rawalpindi last April. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan almost got knocked out of the match after the Allen-Storm. Because Pakistan does not have a record of winning by chasing more than 208 runs. They won this run chase against West Indies in Karachi in 2021. Pakistan&#8217;s top order did not do well in batting with the aim of making a record.</p>



<p>In addition to not being able to score runs with the ball, losing wickets in the early stages put Pakistan under pressure. Opener Saim Ayyub returned with 10 runs off 13 balls. After that, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan scored 39 runs together but played the ball for 28 runs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After that, Fakhar Zaman, who was dropped for four, departed after scoring 19 runs off 10 balls, practically ending Pakistan&#8217;s hopes. Although Babar scored 58 runs off 37 balls today. But Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed failed. As a result, Pakistan left the field with a loss.</p>

<p>Manchester City&#8217;s Norwegian star Arling Haaland and French footballer Kylian Mbappe have again crowned Lionel Messi as FIFA&#8217;s best player of the year. This World Cup winning footballer won the &#8216;FIFA The Best&#8217; award after a hard-fought battle.</p>



<p>Arling Haaland and Messi had equal votes. However, Messi became the first as he was ahead of the national team captains in the first choice list. Not only the captain, but also the coaches of the national teams voted for the player of the year. Media representatives from different countries also voted for the player of the year.</p>



<p>Bangladesh national football team captain Jamal Bhuiyan and coach Javier Cabrera also voted for the best player. Jamal topped Messi&#8217;s best male player poll. Jamal&#8217;s third best player voted for Holland was City star Kevin De Bruyne.</p>



<p>Jamal placed Messi on top of all, but Messi is not in the top three of Spanish coach Cabrera of Bangladesh. In the eyes of the Spanish coach, Holland is the best footballer in 2023. Cabrera&#8217;s next two votes also went to the Premier League and Champions League winning City players&#8217; box. Cabrera&#8217;s second best is Rodri, third best is Ilkay Gundwan.</p>



<p>In addition, in the selection of the best players of the women&#8217;s team, Bangladesh women&#8217;s team captain Sabina Khatun&#8217;s preferred order was Hinata Miyazawa, Sam Carr and Alex Greenwood. None of them made it to the top three. Saiful Bari, the coach of the women&#8217;s team, was voted the best female footballer in the box of Aitana Bonmati.</p>



<p>Raihan Mahmud has voted as the representative of the journalists of Bangladesh. Holland is the best in his eyes. He kept Messi in two. Like Cabrera, he is the third best Gundoan in his eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Lionel Messi won the FIFA Footballer of the Year award for the second time in a row. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The best player of the year was announced at &#8216;The Best FIFA Football Awards&#8217; in London on Monday night.Where two rivals Arling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe behind Messi won the award. However, he could not go to take the award with his own hands. Instead, the award was accepted by the presenter and French legend Thierry Henry.</p>



<p>Last year the award was won by the &#8220;Khude Jadukar&#8221; who led Argentina to the World Cup. Earlier in 2019, he was also selected as the best of the year. After being named &#8216;The Best&#8217;, he won the award for the third time.</p>



<p>However, this victory did not come easily for Messi. As the results of the voting show, Haaland and his two scoring points equal 48. However, Messi was slightly ahead in the first choice list of national team captains. That&#8217;s why the Inter Miami star won the award. And Mbappe finished with 35 points.</p>



<p>Messi has been voted FIFA best player 8 times in total &#8211; in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015.</p>



<p>FIFA has selected the best players in boys football between 19 December 2022 and 20 August 2023. From there, the award of the year went to one person, that is, Messi.</p>



<p>A panel of FIFA experts initially selected 12 players from among the best footballers of the year. From that list, an international jury board (consisting of national team coaches and captains, football journalists and fans voting on FIFA&#8217;s official website) selects the top three.</p>



<p>Messi was in the short list of the best footballer of the year last time like this time. Not only that, he also won the award last time like this time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After winning the World Cup in Qatar, this Argentinian forward played an impeccable role in helping French club PSG win the league last season. He had the highest assists in League One. Although he left PSG at the end of the season and joined the American club Inter Miami. He went there and won the title. Messi also played great for the national team within the time limit set by FIFA. So he was one of the contenders to be the best player of the year this year.</p>



<p>Like Messi, Mbappe played a role in helping PSG win the French league title last season. The forward scored 17 goals in the last 20 matches in League One. At the end of the season he won the top scorer as well as the best player award in League One. He was in great form throughout the season.</p>



<p>Haaland is one of the members of Manchester City who won the treble last season. He kept opponents defenders at bay with speed, power and finishing ability. He won the European Golden Shoe, Premier League Golden Boot, Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year awards. This Norwegian forward scored 28 goals in 33 matches within the time limit set by FIFA. But in the end, his forehead burned for a while.</p>

<p>Brothers Union lost 5-0 to Bashundhara Kings in the Premier League. This time the team of Gopibag lost by a big margin in the Federation Cup.Abahani beat Brothers 6-0 today at Bashundhara Kings Arena. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Washington scored a hat trick for the team. Apart from this, Cornelius scored two goals and Nabib Newaz Jiban scored the other goal. Andres Cruciani&#8217;s Abahani took the lead 15 minutes into the match at the Bashundhara Kings Arena. Washington&#8217;s cross from the edge was not cleared properly by the defender inside the box. Jeevan made no mistake getting the ball in the gap to beat the goalkeeper. After 15 minutes the margin of the match was doubled. Washington is the scorer this time. Brothers Union changed the goalkeeper in the 35th minute. The first half ended with a 2-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>After the break, Abahani&#8217;s attempts were blocked once again by the goalkeeper. In the 56th minute, Cornelius&#8217; shot was blocked by goalkeeper Majnu Mia. It was the Granada striker&#8217;s fifth shot.</p>



<p>Until 70 minutes the Brothers somehow held the defense. However, the next minute was flooded with goals. This half came four more goals! In other words, Abahani opened the scoreboard again in the 71st minute. Taking the ball off a defender&#8217;s feet, Washington entered the box alone and found the goalkeeper alone to give the team the lead for the third goal. Two minutes later Robiul&#8217;s powerful shot from Jonathan&#8217;s free-kick could not be properly saved by a defender. Washington tapped in from in front of the post to complete his first hat trick of the season.</p>



<p>In the 82nd minute, Granada&#8217;s forward Cornelius entered the box from the right side and scored with a strong shot. Cornelius scored another goal in the 86th minute. Cornelius put the final nail in the Brothers&#8217; coffin with a superb left-footed backheel pass from Washington.</p>
