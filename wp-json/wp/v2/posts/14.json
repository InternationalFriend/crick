However, he could not go to take the award with his own hands. Instead, the award was accepted by the presenter and French legend Thierry Henry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year the award was won by the &#8220;Khude Jadukar&#8221; who led Argentina to the World Cup. Earlier in 2019, he was also selected as the best of the year. After being named &#8216;The Best&#8217;, he won the award for the third time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this victory did not come easily for Messi. As the results of the voting show, Haaland and his two scoring points equal 48. However, Messi was slightly ahead in the first choice list of national team captains. That&#8217;s why the Inter Miami star won the award. And Mbappe finished with 35 points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi has been voted FIFA best player 8 times in total &#8211; in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FIFA has selected the best players in boys football between 19 December 2022 and 20 August 2023. From there, the award of the year went to one person, that is, Messi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A panel of FIFA experts initially selected 12 players from among the best footballers of the year. From that list, an international jury board (consisting of national team coaches and captains, football journalists and fans voting on FIFA&#8217;s official website) selects the top three.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi was in the short list of the best footballer of the year last time like this time. Not only that, he also won the award last time like this time. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After winning the World Cup in Qatar, this Argentinian forward played an impeccable role in helping French club PSG win the league last season. He had the highest assists in League One. Although he left PSG at the end of the season and joined the American club Inter Miami. He went there and won the title. Messi also played great for the national team within the time limit set by FIFA. So he was one of the contenders to be the best player of the year this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Messi, Mbappe played a role in helping PSG win the French league title last season. The forward scored 17 goals in the last 20 matches in League One. At the end of the season he won the top scorer as well as the best player award in League One. He was in great form throughout the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haaland is one of the members of Manchester City who won the treble last season. He kept opponents defenders at bay with speed, power and finishing ability. He won the European Golden Shoe, Premier League Golden Boot, Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year awards. This Norwegian forward scored 28 goals in 33 matches within the time limit set by FIFA. But in the end, his forehead burned for a while.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lionel Messi won the FIFA Footballer of the Year award for the second time in a row. &nbsp; The best player of the year was announced at &#8216;The Best FIFA Football Awards&#8217; in London on Monday night.Where two rivals Arling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe behind Messi won the award.
